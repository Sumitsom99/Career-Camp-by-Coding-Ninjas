CODE:-

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner (System.in);
        int n = s.nextInt();
        int i = 2;
        while (i<n){
            if (n%i==0){
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
            i=i+1;
        }
    }
}
