Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of fibonacci series or not. Return true if the number is member of fibonacci series else false.

Fibonacci Series is defined by the recurrence
    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1

Input Format :
Integer N

Output Format :
true or false

Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10^4

Sample Input 1 :
5

Sample Output 1 :
true

Sample Input 2 :
14

Sample Output 2 :
false    

CODE:-

public class Solution {
	public static boolean checkMember(int n){
		int a = 0;
		int b = 1;
		int c;
		while(a < n){
			c = a + b;
			a = b;
			b = c;
	    }
		if(a == n){
			return true;
		}else{
			return false;
		}
	}
}
