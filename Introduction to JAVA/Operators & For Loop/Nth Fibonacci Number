Nth term of Fibonacci series F(n), where F(n) is a function, is calculated using the following formula -

    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), 
    Where, F(1) =  1, 
           F(2) = 1
Provided N you have to find out the Nth Fibonacci Number.

Input Format :
The first line of each test case contains a real number ‘N’.

Output Format :
For each test case, return its equivalent Fibonacci number.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10000     
Where ‘N’ represents the number for which we have to find its equivalent Fibonacci number.

Time Limit: 1 second

Sample Input 1:
6

Sample Output 1:
8

Explanation of Sample Input 1:
Now the number is ‘6’ so we have to find the “6th” Fibonacci number
So by using the property of the Fibonacci series i.e 

[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
So the “6th” element is “8” hence we get the output.

CODE:-

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = s.nextInt();
		int a = 0;
		int b = 1;
		int c;
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
			c = a + b;
			a = b;
			b = c;
		}
		System.out.println(a);
	}
}
